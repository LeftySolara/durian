#### Durian - A Very Simple MPD Client
---

Durian is a basic Qt client for MPD written in C++.

I am no longer working on this program. The goal of this project was to get some practice using Qt and the MPD library.
Durian in its current state could be considered a Minimum Viable Product, with the code being examples of some of the basic functionality
of Qt and MPD.
